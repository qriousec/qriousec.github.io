Last year, we welcomed three new members to the Qrious junior team. Our ongoing mission is to support the next generation of Vietnamese hackers who are passionate about discovering and exploiting software vulnerabilities. We aim to provide a space where they can hone their skills, share the ups and downs of their hacking experiences, and find encouragement during challenging times.

We have seen some promising results from our juniors:

- Trung pwned the Sonos speaker at Pwn2Own Mobile Toronto.
- Lan exploited a zero-day vulnerability against Chrome GPU process.

Initially, we were uncertain if our approach would bring any value to anyone in this highly specialized field. However, we strongly believe that continuously tackling difficult problems and learning from them is undoubtedly the right path. By mentoring our juniors, we (the senior members) not only clarify our own objectives and refine our vulnerability research methodologies but also reach new heights:

- We successfully pwned Samsung Galaxy at two consecutive editions of Pwn2Own Mobile Toronto.
- We have successfully exploited the Linux Kernel and Chrome in both the Kernel CTF and V8 CTF using zero-day exploits.
- We reported a total of six zero-days in Chrome, including a full chain to the Chrome GPU process (not fully disclosed yet!).
- We also disclosed a few other LPEs in Windows Kernel and Linux Kernel at Pwn2Own Vancouver and TyphoonPwn Seoul.
- Plus, we have many more undisclosed zero-days (undoubtedly)...

Encouraged by our successes, we’ve decided to expand the junior team. We are opening 2-3 positions for university students, and we’re also considering highly motivated high school students. If you believe you qualify, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/dYiPYSqfZadt2cfg8), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
